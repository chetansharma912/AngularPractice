    <h2>History Of CSS</h2>
    <h3>Origins and Development</h3>
    <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was developed by the <b><i>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</i></b>, an international organization responsible for setting web standards. The development of CSS was significantly influenced by the work of <b>H책kon Wium Lie</b> and <b>Bert Bos</b>.
        <br><br>
        The concept of CSS was first proposed by <b>H책kon Wium Lie</b> in <b><i>1994</i></b>. At that time, web design and presentation were primarily managed through HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which was originally intended to structure content rather than control its appearance. Lie recognized that as web pages became more complex, the limitations of HTML for styling and layout were becoming increasingly apparent. He envisioned CSS as a solution to separate the content of a web page from its presentation, allowing for greater flexibility and control over the visual aspects of web design.
        <br><br>
        Bert Bos also played a crucial role in the development of CSS. He collaborated with Lie to refine and implement the CSS specifications, ensuring that the new style sheet language would be both practical and effective for web designers and developers.
        <br><br>
        CSS was officially introduced to the web standards community by the W3C as a way to address the growing need for more sophisticated and adaptable styling options. By separating content from design, CSS allowed for more efficient web development and improved the consistency and manageability of website appearance across different devices and browsers.

        <b>Developer:</b> CSS was developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with significant contributions from H책kon Wium Lie and Bert Bos. H책kon Wium Lie first proposed the concept of CSS in 1994 as a way to solve the problems of document presentation on the web being controlled solely by HTML.
        <br><br>
        <b>Purpose:</b> The main goal was to separate the content of a document (HTML) from its presentation aspects (fonts, colors, layout), making web development more accessible and web pages more adaptable to different types of devices.
    </p>
    <h3>Early Versions</h3>
    <p> 
        <b>CSS1:</b> The first official specification for CSS was published in December 1996. It introduced basic features for text styling and font properties, margins, padding, color and background styling, and the box model.
        <br><br>
        <b>CSS2:</b> Released in May 1998, CSS2 expanded on CSS1 with more sophisticated selectors, positioning, media types, and other properties.
    </p>
    <h3>Evolution and Modern CSS</h3>
    <p>
        <b>CSS 2.1:</b> An important revision that fixed inconsistencies and errors found in CSS2. It became a W3C Recommendation in June 2011 and is widely supported across all browsers.
        <br><br>
        <b>CSS3:</b> Rather than being released as a single, monolithic specification, CSS3 is divided into several separate modules, each adding new features and capabilities. These modules include Selectors, Box Model, Backgrounds and Borders, Text Effects, 2D/3D Transformations, Animations, Flexbox, Grid Layout, and more. Modules are standardized independently, allowing for faster development and browser implementation.
